## About me:

I worked for a long time as a shop assistant and I saw how quickly new technology shows up in our daily life. Now I want to develop my skills according to these changes and become a part of the modern industrial revolution. I am interested in the whole quality assurance processes and I hope to become QA Manager in the further future, but for now I want to improve my skills as a Software Tester, because I like exploring new applications, finding new useful tools, looking deeply into new features, and tracking different bugs and mistakes.

## Me in few words:

- 👀 I'm interested in software testing and Quality Assurance.
- 🔭 I’m currently looking for my first job as a Junior Software Tester.
